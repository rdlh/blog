## Use your brain well

### StyleGuides (because 'Best practices' are > all)

- [GitHub's styleguides](https://github.com/styleguide)
  - [CSS](https://github.com/styleguide/css)
    <br><br> Welcome to the GitHub CSS Styleguide. It's pretty rad. Before reading this, you should have a general understanding for specificity, the [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) syntax, and [KSS](http://warpspire.com/kss/) documentation..<br><br>
  - [Ruby](https://github.com/styleguide/ruby)
    <br><br> Much of this was taken from [bbatsov/ruby-style-guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide). Please add to this guide if you find any particular patterns or styles that we've adopted internally. Submit a pull request to ask for feedback (if you're an employee).<br><br>
  - [JavaScript](https://github.com/styleguide/javascript)
    <br><br> If you're visiting from the internet, feel free to learn from our style. This is a guide we use for our own apps internally at GitHub. We encourage you to set up one that works for your own team.<br><br>

### Uglifiers

- Uglifiers
  - [with Ruby](https://github.com/lautis/uglifier)
    <br><br> Ensure that your environment has a JavaScript interpreter supported by ExecJS. Using therubyracer gem is a safe choice if a runtime isn't already present. Note that while JScript built-in Windows 7 and older works, it is extremely slow.<br><br>
  - [with JavaScript](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/)
    <br><br> UglifyJS is a JavaScript parser, minifier, compressor or beautifier toolkit. This page documents the command line utility. For API and internals documentation see my website. There's also an [in-browser online demo](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/#demo) (for Firefox, Chrome and probably Safari).<br><br>
